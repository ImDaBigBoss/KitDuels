# KitDuels
This is a simple kit duels plugin for a Minecraft Spigot server. It will require the [VoidGen](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/voidgen.25391/) plugin so you can create maps.<br>
**Please note that this project is a work in progress and will probably be full of bugs!**

## Commands
* `/kd` to access all the commands needed to setup this plugin.
* `/joingame <num players/map name>` to join a map
* `leavegame` to leave a map
